## Development Methodology

We used the **Agile** methodology to ensure flexibility and iterative development.

### Development Plan:
1. **Planning:**  
   - Define core features: waste scanning, ranking, rewards.  
   - Design the architecture for frontend-backend integration.  

2. **Design:**  
   - Create UI/UX prototypes in Figma.  
   - Design the initial database schema.  

3. **Implementation:**  
   - Build the waste scanning and gamification features.  
   - Test core functionality to ensure reliability.  

4. **Integration:**  
   - Integrate the Flutter frontend with the Laravel backend.  
   - Refine UI/UX based on feedback.  

5. **Testing & Launch:**  
   - Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT).  
   - Release a Beta version for limited users and gather feedback.  
   - Optimize for the full release.
